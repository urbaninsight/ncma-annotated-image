To do
- Verify behavior of filtering for station, with and without prompts. Can I filter for a prompt without a station?
- Refactor / Clean up the thickbox modals and document how admin form data gets submitted to the server
- Add a timestamp to the response table and sort admin page chronologically by default
- Create rest endpoints to GET and POST responses
- Stress test the GET endpoint for 3000+ responses
